    name: "What is ScrollSight",
    info: `ScrollSight is definitely not the future of document viewing, but it tries its best. Imagine reading something and watching a little bar on the side cheer you on as you scroll — that's basically the pitch. There's no deeper purpose, no productivity gain, just a bit of scroll-fueled satisfaction.

In the land of serious productivity tools, ScrollSight enters like a kid with stickers. It's here to add a splash of fun to what would otherwise be a dry wall of text. Will it make you read more? Probably not. But will you feel cooler while doing it? Definitely maybe.

The idea started when someone scrolled through a super long Pinterest post and thought, "what if this… but stylish?" And thus, this entire concept was born — a document reader that exists mainly to look good while doing the one thing we all do: scroll endlessly. Welcome to ScrollSight. It won’t change your life, but it might make reading your own notes feel like unlocking levels in a casual game.`

    name: "Key Functionalities",
    info: `The main functionality? Scrolling. The secondary functionality? Also scrolling, but now with feedback. As you journey through the majestic paragraphs of this document, a lovely little progress tab keeps up with your pace like a loyal pet. It doesn’t bark, it doesn’t beep, it just politely updates itself as you move.

There’s no login, no profile, no storage. Just vibes. The scroll bar glides alongside your reading like it’s trying to impress you. You might find yourself scrolling faster just to watch it move. That's fine. That’s the point.

You can’t highlight, edit, or interact with the text in any meaningful way — and that’s intentional. This isn't Google Docs, this is ScrollSight: the scenic route of document readers. Here, we take the long way through information, and we enjoy every pixel of it.`

    id: "section-3",
    Title: "Core Features",
    name: "Experimental Interactions",
    info: `Okay, so you’re still reading. That’s impressive. ScrollSight rewards that dedication with the finest micro-interactions known to this side of the internet. As you scroll, maybe something pulses. Maybe the background gently shifts colors like a moody lava lamp. Maybe nothing happens, but you *think* it does. That’s design magic.

Hover over a title? It grows. Click on it? Nothing happens. We didn’t build that part. But the point is — the document feels alive. It’s subtle, it’s smooth, and most importantly, it doesn’t get in your way. The scroll bar might even throw a little shimmer when you pass a major section, like it’s saying “good job!” without being too clingy.

These are the experimental touches that make ScrollSight not *just* a reader, but an unnecessary experience. You’ll wonder why other readers aren’t doing it — and then remember they’re too busy being useful.`

    Title: "Design Philosophy",
    name: "Minimal & Focused",
    info: `Our design philosophy can be summarized in three words: less is less. We stripped away all the helpful features to make space for something else — aesthetics. The layout is mostly white space, with the occasional paragraph floating like a thought cloud. Fonts were chosen based on how pretentious they looked, and spacing is measured in “how floaty does this feel?”

There are no borders. Just invisible lines of intention. No hard edges. Only gentle shadows suggesting structure. It’s design, but in italics.

The idea is to create an environment so calm and minimal that you begin to question whether you’re still reading or just meditating. And that’s the sweet spot. ScrollSight doesn’t scream for your attention — it whispers, with excellent kerning.`

    Title: "Use Case",
    name: "Personal Docs",
    info: `Personal documents deserve personality. Whether it’s your daily thoughts, your game idea you’ll never build, or that long-form fanfic you wrote under a pseudonym — ScrollSight is the place to read it like it matters. Because here, everything looks cooler by default.

You could use it to read old notes, copy-pasted Wikipedia articles, or your best friend’s chaotic ramblings. Maybe you paste your to-do list here and pretend it’s a philosophy essay. That’s valid. This is a judgment-free scroll zone.

In ScrollSight, every document becomes a digital stroll. You might start reading about your grocery plan and end up writing a manifesto. That’s the beauty of this experience — it transforms even the most mundane content into a full-screen, cinematic scroll sesh. Welcome to your text’s glow-up.`
